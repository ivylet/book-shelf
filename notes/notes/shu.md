Good morning, professors. It' s my great honor to be here for the interview, and I hope I can make a good performance today.

My name is xxx, I' m 23 years old and I come from ZheJiang WenZhou, a very beautiful ancient city.The atmosphere in my hometown is relatively relaxing. People work hard in the daytime but in the night, you can find many people wandering in the parks, dancing in the squares, or drinking tea together in the teahouses.

I will get my bachelor’s degree this July. My major is computer science in computer science department of xx University at xx.

During the past four years, I have learned a lot of professional knowledge and practical skills, but gradually, I realize it is not enough. In my opinion, further study is actually urgent for me to realize and finally achieve [self-value](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=self-value&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A1801623700%7D). Life is precious, it is necessary to catch any opportunity for self-development, especially in the competitive [modern society](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=modern%20society&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A1801623700%7D). Therefore, I prefer to go on for further education.

I am deeply impressed by the academic [atmosphere](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=atmosphere&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A1801623700%7D) when connecting to the web site of your department. If I got a chance to study here, I would like to continue to accept professional [training](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=training&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A1801623700%7D), in order to get ready for working in the future. I hope I can achieve my goal soon.

There must be many things to learn if I were enrolled into my ideal research field. I hope I can build up a systematic view of CS, especially in the fields of software development. Sincerely, my wish is to get a complete comprehension of software development.

On the other [hand](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=hand&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A1801623700%7D), I am dreaming of the participation of some relevant projects of my major, for this reason, I will get more experience in practice. And what's more, I expect to continue my study for doctorate [degree](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=degree&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A1801623700%7D), if it is possible. In a word, I am looking forward to making up a solid foundation for future

profession which is based on three years of study here.

I think I’m an optimistic, [open-minded](https://www.zhihu.com/search?q=open-minded&search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_source=Entity&hybrid_search_extra=%7B%22sourceType%22%3A%22answer%22%2C%22sourceId%22%3A1801623700%7D), responsibility person. I will try my best to do everything well.

In my spare time, I like reading books, playing pingpong, communicating with friends, and so on.

I also like English very much, I am fond of watching English movies and listening to English songs, I passed CET-6 in September,2018, I do believe there is still a long way for me to learn English well enough, however I will not shrink back, Because I realize that English is a bridge connected our country with the outside world. Learning English is the most direct and available method for intercourse among countries and also useful for us to get advanced knowledge and technology from other nations.
